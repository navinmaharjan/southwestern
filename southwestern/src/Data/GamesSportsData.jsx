        'detail': 'Games and sports in school encompass more than just the benefit of physical activity. Increases in self-esteem and mental alertness make school sports and games necessary for every school age child. At Southwestern, games and sports are given top priority and a wide range of games and sports are made available for students. Games and sports like Badminton, Basketball, Cricket, Chess, Table Tennis, Soccer, etc are more popular among students. Students try Netball and Floor Ball too in school. Students play various games through their regular game-periods as well. Besides regular games and sports, school organizes ‘Sports Week’ every year as planned in academic calendar. ‘Sports Week’ is an annual event, to encourage the participation and as part of our commitment to delivering high-quality PE and sport across the school. All children at Southwestern take part in a series of sporting activities during a ‘Sports Week’, organised to compete among them. Games and sports are more important in Pre-Primary. Apart from conducting regular PE for them we do organize Sports Week in terminal basis.'
